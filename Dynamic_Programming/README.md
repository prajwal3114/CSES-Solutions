# 🧮 CSES Dynamic Programming Problems

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming** section of my CSES solutions repository!  
This section contains **C++ implementations** of all major **DP-related problems** from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

## 🧭 Overview

This folder focuses on mastering key **Dynamic Programming (DP)** concepts using both **recursive (memoization)** and **iterative (tabulation)** approaches.

### Topics Covered:
- Subproblems & Overlapping Substructure  
- Optimal Substructure  
- Recursion + Memoization  
- Iterative Tabulation  
- Space Optimization  
- 1D, 2D, and Bitmask DP  
- DP on Grids and Trees

## 🧩 Notable Problems
- Coin Combinations I & II  
- Minimizing Coins  
- Dice Combinations  
- Removing Digits  
- Book Shop  
- Grid Paths  
- Array Description  
- Edit Distance  

---

## ⚙️ Language & Approach
- **Language:** C++17  
- **Approach:** Clean, modular, and well-commented  
- **Goal:** Clarity, reusability, and optimization

## 🧠 Goal
To build a strong foundation in **Dynamic Programming** by understanding:
- How to define states and transitions  
- How to optimize space and time complexity  
- How to convert recursive logic into efficient iterative solutions
