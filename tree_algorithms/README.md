# 🌳 CSES Tree Algorithms Problems

Welcome to the **Tree Algorithms** section of my CSES solutions repository!  
This folder contains **C++ implementations** of fundamental and advanced **tree-based algorithms** from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

## 🧭 Overview

This section focuses on understanding and solving problems related to **trees**, which are connected, acyclic graphs. The problems here help build strong intuition for **DFS-based techniques**, hierarchical structures, and efficient query processing.

Key concepts covered include:
- Tree Traversals (DFS & BFS)
- Subtree Size and Depth Calculations
- Tree Diameter
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- Binary Lifting
- Tree DP
- Rerooting Techniques
- Path and Distance Queries
- Euler Tour Technique

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand trees as a special form of graphs
- Master recursive and iterative DFS approaches
- Learn to compute subtree properties efficiently
- Solve LCA and path queries in logarithmic time
- Apply dynamic programming on trees
- Improve problem-solving skills for competitive programming
